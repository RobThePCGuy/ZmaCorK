# ZmaCorK
Z390-A PRO + macOS + OpenCore + i5-9600K = ZmaCorK
 
# My macOS 11.x OpenCore Hackintosh
 
## The Following Equipment is Required
 
- `MSI Z390-A PRO`
- `Intel i5-9600K`
 
## Pre-Install Steps
### Resize The EFI/System Partition to 1GB
- For this I use **[MiniTool Partition Wizard](https://www.partitionwizard.com/free-partition-manager.html)**.
- Shrink the OS Part by `884MB`
- Delete the **MSR** Partition.
- Extend the EFI Partition to `1GB`
- Apply and reboot.
 
### Download macOS Recovery Files
- Follow along in this [guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/winblows-install.html#downloading-macos) until you reach **Making The Installer**.
- Once you have the `BaseSystem.chunklist` & `BaseSystem.dmg` files create a folder called `com.apple.recovery.boot` and move them into it.
- Drag the new folder to your `C:` drive.
 
### Download Repo and Generate Unique Serials
- Download my repo from GitHub or click **[here](https://github.com/ZeroOneZero/ZmaCorK/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**
- Open the zip and extract just the `EFI` folder to your `C:` drive.
- Download the config.plist editor from **[here](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree)**
- Extract the zip and run the .bat file.
- Open->C:\EFI\OC\config.plist
- Then follow just the **PlatformInfo** steps **[here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/coffee-lake.html#platforminfo)** to generate your own unique Board Serial, MLB & UUID.
 
*Note: Using this repo without generating your own serials will not work as I have commented them out in the config.plist*
 
- After replacing the four `#` in the plist, save and continue below.
- Open an Admin Command Prompt and run:
 
- `mountvol X: /S`
- `xcopy C:\EFI X:\EFI /E /H /C /I /Y`
- `xcopy C:\com.apple.recovery.boot X:\com.apple.recovery.boot /E /H /C /I /Y`
 
*Mounts the System Partition and copies the folders we moved to C: into it.*
 
### Add Boot Entry for OpenCore
- Download **[BOOTICEx64](https://m.majorgeeks.com/index.php?ct=files&action=download&)**
- Extract and run the exe
- UEFI->Edit Boot Entries
- At the least youâ€™ll see **Windows Boot Manager** in the list.
- Select **Add** then type into the **File Name** box at the bottom of the window that opened.
`X:\EFI\OC\OpenCore.efi`
- Click **Okay** and you should see **Successfully added boot entry**.
- In **Menu Title** type `OpenCore`.
- Click on **Save current boot entry**
- Last, **Close->Exit** and reboot to enter the BIOS settings below.
 
## Setting Up The BIOS
 
### MSI Z390-A PRO / BIOS Revision: 7B98v1D
*During boot repeatedly taping the **Delete** key on the keyboard will open the BIOS*
 
- `Factory Default Settings by Pressing F6`
- `Enter Advanced Mode by Pressing F7`
- `[Settings -> Advanced]: Above 4G memory/Crypto Currency mining: [Disabled]->[Enabled]`
- `[Settings -> Integrated Graphics Configuration]: Initiate Graphic Adapter: [PEG]->[IGD]`
- `[Settings -> Integrated Graphics Configuration]: Integrated Graphics Share Memory [64M]`

- `[OC -> CPU Features]: SW Guard Extensions (SGX): [Software Controlled]->[Disabled]`
 
## Boot It Up
- After saving the BIOS changes, have your Display Port (DP) cable connected.
- I use a DP->HDMI cable that plugs into a ARC port on the TV so it pulls in the audio as well.
- Boot your PC pressing F11 until you see the Boot options screen
- Select OpenCore
*May be listed as **UEFI OS***
- Select recovery.dmg to start macOS install.
- Refer [here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installation/installation-process.html#booting-the-opencore-usb) for any troubleshooting.
